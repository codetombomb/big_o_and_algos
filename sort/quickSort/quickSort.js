//                          QUICK SORT

// - Like merge sort, exploits the fact that arrays of 0 or 1 elements 
//are always sorted.

// - Works by selecting one element (called the 'pivot') and finding
//the index wehre the pivot should end up in the sorted array.

// - Once the pivot is positioned appropriately, quick sort can be 
//applied on either side of the pivot.
