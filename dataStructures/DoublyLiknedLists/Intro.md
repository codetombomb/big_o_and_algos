# üìù Intro to Doubly Linked Lists

## Objectives

- Construct a Doubly Linked List 
- Compare and contrast Doubly and Singly Linked Lists
- Implement basic operations on a Doubly Linked List.

### <u>What is a Doubly Linked List?</u>
<b>Almost</b> Identical to Singly Linked Lists, except every node has <b>another</b> poitner, to the <b>previous</b> node! A pointer from each node fore and aft is how DLL gets its name.
</br></br>
The usage of prev pointers makes it possible to move/iterate backwards at the expense of two-times memory usage requirement as now each vertex records one additional pointer. The positive side effect of this ability to move backwards is now we can address the weak removal at tail case of the Singly Linked List.

Here is a working example of how DLL works by [VisuAlgo](https://visualgo.net/en/list)

## Comparison with Singly Linked Lists
<u><b>Doubly Linked Lists</b></u>
- Able to start iterating from the tail to the head of the list using 'list.prev' like 'list.next' on SLL
- Requires more memory becasue of the connections in two directions
- Removal of nodes is constant time compared to Singly Linked List

<u><b>Singly Linked Lists</b></u>
- Can only move from nodes in one direction
- Uses less memory than DLL
- Removal of nodes is O(N) 


Doubly Linked Lists are almost identical to SLLs except there is an additional pointer to previous nodes.
They are better than SLLs for finding nodes and can be done in half the time.
However, they do take up more memory considering the extra pointer.


#Big O of DLL
- <b>Insertion</b> - O(1)
- <b>Removal</b> - O(1)
- <b>Searching</b> - O(N)
- <b>Access</b> -O(n)

**Technically, searching is O(N / 2), but that's still O(N)
